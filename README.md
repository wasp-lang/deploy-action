# deploy-action üöÄ
Github Action to deploy with Wasp to Fly.io

## How to setup Deploy on Push

### Launch your app locally once ‚ö†Ô∏è

- You should first launch your app locally with `wasp deploy fly launch <basename> <region>`.
- After your app is launched, make sure to commit the `fly-server.toml` and `fly-client.toml` files.

### Get your API token from Fly.io

- Login with Fly.io and go here: https://fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens
- Click `Create token` and copy that value.

### Add the token as a secret

Add your Fly.io token as a repository secret e.g. calling it `FLY_TOKEN`

Read more about how to do it: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository

### Setting a Custom Server URL

If you have configured a custom domain for your server, you can specify it as a repository secret named `SERVER_URL`. If this is not defined, Wasp will default to using the `<app-name>-server.fly.dev` address.

For detailed instructions on setting up repository secrets, visit: [GitHub Docs: Creating Encrypted Secrets for a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

### Add a Github Action
Create a file called `deploy.yml` in `.github/workflows` folder in your repo with this content:
```yml
name: Deploy to Fly

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy with Wasp
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: wasp-lang/deploy-action@main
        with:
          fly-token: ${{ secrets.FLY_TOKEN }}
          server-url: ${{ secrets.SERVER_URL }}
```

Notice that we are using the `secrets.FLY_TOKEN` so Wasp knows how to deploy.
